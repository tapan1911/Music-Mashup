# Music-Mashup
Music-Mashup is an application which helps playing a playlist allowing for smooth mid-song transitions while ensuring lyrical
and emotional relevance tailored to your personal preferences aka your own “in-house DJ”. 

In today's world, on one hand there are applications like Spotify, SoundCloud etc. which provide great playlists for every
mood and event but DO NOT allow smooth mid-song transitions and on the other hand there are applications like Pacemaker which
allow for cropping and editing of music files but require in depth domain knowledge and are not automated.
